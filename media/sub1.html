                <h3>THE CLUB</h3>
                <p>SSC Napoli SpA has always been one of the most popular football teams in Italy. As it emerges, in fact, 
                  from many market surveys carried out by specialized clubs, the Neapolitan club can count on a fan base 
                  that ranks in the top four in Italy, for the number and for the strong spirit of belonging shown by its fans.</p>

                   <p> In over eighty years of history, Napoli has been able to conquer a glorious "palmares", which 
                    boasts prestigious achievements in Italy and also in the international field such as 2 Scudetti - 6 Italian Cups 
                    - 2 Italian Super Cups - 1 UEFA Cup, etc. </p>
                    
                <p>The most exciting period in the history of Napoli coincides with the second half of the eighties, 
                  when, together with other prestigious champions, the strongest player in the world played in the ranks of Napoli, namely Diego Armando Maradona.</p>

                  <p>In 2004, when SSC Naples went bankrupt after 78 years with a debt of  70 million,
                     De Laurentis acquired Naples in Serie C for 39 million with the dream of rebuilding it to the glory days of Diego Maradona's 1980s.</p>
